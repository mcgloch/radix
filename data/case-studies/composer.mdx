**Describe the type of project you are using Radix on?**

We are building a web app using ClojureScript, Reagent (a React wrapper), Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. Composer’s design system is in its formative stage; we follow the atomic design methodology and always strive to design reusable component patterns throughout the app.

**In what ways has Radix helped you and your company?**

Being able to incrementally adopt Radix Primitives has been invaluable as it helped us replace old components one at a time without any breaking changes.

The biggest win has been no longer having to fight z-index wars since Radix manages all the stacking contexts with portals.

Radix has made our product significantly more accessible and reduced code complexity while allowing us to focus on building complex trading software.

**What are your thoughts on Radix developer experience?**

The DX is ✨magic✨. Composing primitives to our preferences and styling them how we like with Tailwind is a breeze. We love that implementing a primitive feels as easy as implementing an HTML element but with 100x more flexibility.

We also appreciate that the team is always responsive on Discord and willing to help us through any roadblocks we face, especially considering we use ClojureScript and have challenges that can be unique to our language.

**What are your thoughts on Radix docs?**

The documentation is straightforward and well-written with realistic examples that make it easy to adopt a primitive. The beauty is that the concepts are relatively the same across the primitives, so you don’t have to access the documentation frequently.
